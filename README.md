# Basic Process: 
# (Step 1) Gather a table of articles categorized by title, description, URL, Date, Relevancy, Opinion
# (Step 2) Based on the title and description, I ask GPT whether or not this article is 'relevant' for further analysis. 
# (Step 3) Then for all 'relevant' articles, I scrap the web data from its URL.
# (Step 4) With the scrap data, I input this back to GPT, asking for its opinion on how this article may affect stock performance.
# (Step 5) GPT will return either Good News(stock price goes up), Bad News(stock price goes down), or Neutral News(neither). 
# (Step 6)
